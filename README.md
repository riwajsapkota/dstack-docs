### What is dstack?

`dstack` is the easiest way to build data and ML-based web applications, and share it with others. `dstack` can be easily run locally or over containers. It can be deployed to dedicated servers or to any cloud. Deployment of `dstack` applications is done with a few lines of Python code, either from scripts or from Jupyter notebooks. Once a `dstack` application is deployed, you can share the application with others.
