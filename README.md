### What is dstack?

`dstack` is the easiest way of building data and ML applications for non-technical colleagues within the company. `dstack` helps build internal in-house data applications, e.g. for quick prototypes of ML models, or for advanced analysis or prediction in business units as an addition to normal business intelligence tools \(`Tableau`, `Power BI`, `QuilkSense`, `Metabase`, `Superset`, etc\). 

`dstack` can be easily run locally or over containers. It can be deployed to dedicated servers or to any cloud. Deployment of `dstack` applications is done with a few lines of Python code. It can be done either from scripts or from Jupyter notebooks. Once a `dstack` application is deployed, you can immediately invite other users to work with it.
